Dear Shareholders,

As we reflect on the past year, I'm struck by both how much has changed and how much has remained constant. We've grown, we've adapted, we've faced challenges we couldn't have anticipated. But our core mission—to build products that matter, to create value for all stakeholders, to operate with integrity—has remained unchanged.

## Financial Performance

This year, we achieved revenue of $187 million, representing 28% growth over the previous year. Our gross margin improved to 74%, and we achieved profitability for the first time, with net income of $12.3 million.

### Key Financial Metrics

| Metric | 2024 | 2025 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Revenue | $146M | $187M | +28% |
| Gross Margin | 71% | 74% | +3pp |
| Operating Margin | -8% | 4% | +12pp |
| Net Income | -$11.7M | $12.3M | +$24M |
| Customers | 2,340 | 3,120 | +33% |
| ARR | $152M | $198M | +30% |

These results reflect not just growth, but sustainable, profitable growth. We've maintained our focus on building a business that can thrive over the long term, not just scale quickly.

## Strategic Initiatives

### Product Innovation

This year, we launched three major product updates that have been well-received by customers:

1. **AI-Powered Automation**: Our new AI features have reduced manual work for customers by an average of 15 hours per week, leading to higher satisfaction and retention.

2. **Enterprise Security Suite**: We invested heavily in security and compliance, achieving SOC 2 Type II certification and adding enterprise-grade features that have opened new market opportunities.

3. **International Expansion**: We launched localized versions in five new markets, with particular success in Europe and Asia-Pacific.

### Market Position

We've strengthened our position as a leader in our category. Our Net Promoter Score increased to 68, and our customer retention rate reached 95%. These metrics matter because they reflect not just satisfaction, but loyalty—customers who choose to stay with us year after year.

## Challenges and Opportunities

The past year has not been without challenges. Supply chain disruptions affected our hardware products, requiring us to find alternative suppliers and adjust our manufacturing processes. The competitive landscape has intensified, with new entrants and increased pressure on pricing.

But these challenges have also created opportunities. We've built stronger relationships with suppliers, developed more resilient supply chains, and focused on differentiation through superior product quality and customer service rather than competing solely on price.

## Looking Ahead

As we look to the coming year, we see significant opportunities for continued growth:

1. **Market Expansion**: We plan to enter three new geographic markets, building on the success of our international expansion.

2. **Product Development**: We're investing in next-generation features that will further differentiate our products and create new value for customers.

3. **Sustainability**: We're committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2026, and we've made significant progress toward that goal this year.

4. **Talent**: We've grown our team from 180 to 240 people, and we plan to continue investing in talent as we scale.

## Our Commitment

To our shareholders, I want to be clear about our priorities:

1. **Long-term Value Creation**: We make decisions based on what will create the most value over the long term, not what will maximize short-term results.

2. **Sustainable Growth**: We're building a business that can grow profitably and sustainably, not one that burns cash in pursuit of rapid expansion.

3. **Stakeholder Value**: We believe that creating value for all stakeholders—customers, employees, shareholders, and the communities we serve—is the path to long-term success.

4. **Transparency**: We're committed to being transparent about our performance, our challenges, and our plans.

## Gratitude

Finally, I want to express my gratitude. To our customers, who trust us with their business. To our employees, who bring their best every day. To our partners, who support us in countless ways. And to you, our shareholders, who believe in our mission and our ability to execute.

Building a company is a long-term project. It requires patience, discipline, and the willingness to make decisions that may not pay off immediately but will create value over time. We're committed to that approach, and we're grateful to have shareholders who share that vision.

Thank you for your continued support.

Sincerely,

[CEO Name]  
Chief Executive Officer
