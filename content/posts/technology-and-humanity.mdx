excerpt: The relationship between technology and human flourishing is more complex than optimists and pessimists would have us believe.

Technology is neither good nor evil. It is a tool, and like all tools, its value depends on how it is used. But this simple truth obscures a more complex reality: technology shapes us even as we shape it. The tools we create change the way we think, work, and relate to one another.

The optimists tell us that technology will solve our problems, that innovation will lift us all, that progress is inevitable and beneficial. The pessimists warn of job loss, surveillance, and the erosion of human connection. Both perspectives contain truth, but both are incomplete.

The real question is not whether technology is good or bad, but how we can ensure that technological progress serves human flourishing. This requires intentionality. It requires asking, at each step: does this make life better? Does this enhance human capability without diminishing human dignity?

We have seen technologies that clearly serve human good: medical advances, communication tools, educational resources. We have also seen technologies that create new problems even as they solve old ones: social media that connects us while isolating us, automation that increases efficiency while eliminating jobs.

The pattern is clear: technology amplifies. It amplifies our capabilities, but also our flaws. It amplifies connection, but also division. It amplifies information, but also misinformation. The question is not whether to use technology, but how to use it wisely.

This requires a new kind of literacy. Not just technical literacy—understanding how technology works—but ethical literacy: understanding how technology affects us, individually and collectively. It requires the ability to evaluate not just what technology can do, but what it should do.

The future will be shaped by those who understand that technology is a means, not an end. That human values must guide technological development, not the other way around. That progress is not measured by what we can build, but by whether what we build makes life better.

This is not a call to slow down innovation. It is a call to be more thoughtful about its direction. To ask harder questions. To make better choices. To ensure that as we build the future, we do not lose sight of what makes us human.
