## Fiction

**The Overstory** by Richard Powers  
A novel about trees that becomes a meditation on time, connection, and what it means to pay attention. The structure itself—nine characters whose stories eventually intertwine like roots—is a work of art.

**Klara and the Sun** by Kazuo Ishiguro  
Ishiguro's exploration of artificial intelligence and consciousness, told through the perspective of an AI companion. Quiet, profound, and deeply moving.

**The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo** by Taylor Jenkins Reid  
A masterclass in narrative structure, with layers of revelation that keep you turning pages. More than entertainment—it's a study in how we construct our own stories.

**Project Hail Mary** by Andy Weir  
Science fiction that makes you feel the wonder of discovery. The problem-solving, the scientific rigor, the humor—it's everything I want in a book.

**The Midnight Library** by Matt Haig  
A simple premise executed beautifully: what if you could try out all the lives you might have lived? The answer is more nuanced than you'd expect.

## Philosophy & Essays

**The Art of Living** by Epictetus (translated by Sharon Lebell)  
Stoic philosophy made accessible. This is the book I return to when life feels chaotic. Practical wisdom from two thousand years ago that feels completely relevant.

**Meditations** by Marcus Aurelius  
The private thoughts of a Roman emperor, written for himself, never meant to be published. There's something deeply human about reading someone's personal struggle to be better.

**The Consolations of Philosophy** by Alain de Botton  
Philosophy as therapy, as practical guidance for living. De Botton makes complex ideas accessible without dumbing them down.

**How to Do Nothing** by Jenny Odell  
A critique of the attention economy and a guide to reclaiming your time and attention. Essential reading for anyone who feels overwhelmed by modern life.

**The Uninhabitable Earth** by David Wallace-Wells  
Climate change made real, specific, and urgent. Difficult to read, impossible to ignore.

## Science & Technology

**The Code Breaker** by Walter Isaacson  
The story of CRISPR and the scientists who developed it. A reminder that scientific breakthroughs are made by people, with all their flaws and brilliance.

**The Premonition** by Michael Lewis  
How a small group of people saw the pandemic coming and tried to warn us. A study in how systems fail and how individuals can make a difference.

**Range** by David Epstein  
Why generalists triumph in a specialized world. A counterargument to the 10,000-hour rule that's backed by compelling research.

**The Alignment Problem** by Brian Christian  
How do we make AI systems that align with human values? This book explores one of the most important questions of our time.

**The Art of Statistics** by David Spiegelhalter  
Statistics made understandable and relevant. If you've ever wondered how to interpret data, this is the book.

## History & Biography

**Empire of Pain** by Patrick Radden Keefe  
The story of the Sackler family and the opioid crisis. Meticulously researched, beautifully written, deeply disturbing.

**The Splendid and the Vile** by Erik Larson  
Winston Churchill during the Blitz, told through the lens of daily life. History made immediate and personal.

**Say Nothing** by Patrick Radden Keefe  
The Troubles in Northern Ireland, told through the story of one disappearance. A masterful work of narrative nonfiction.

**The Warmth of Other Suns** by Isabel Wilkerson  
The Great Migration of African Americans from the South. Essential American history, beautifully told.

**Sapiens** by Yuval Noah Harari  
A brief history of humankind. Ambitious, thought-provoking, and guaranteed to change how you see the world.

## Business & Work

**The Hard Thing About Hard Things** by Ben Horowitz  
Startup advice that's honest about how hard it actually is. No sugar-coating, just real experience.

**Range** by David Epstein  
Already mentioned, but worth repeating. The case for breadth over depth in a world that values specialization.

**The Infinite Game** by Simon Sinek  
A framework for thinking about business and life as infinite games rather than finite ones. Changes how you approach strategy.

**Working** by Robert Caro  
How one of the greatest biographers does his work. A masterclass in research, writing, and persistence.

**The Culture Code** by Daniel Coyle  
What makes groups effective? This book has answers backed by research and illustrated with compelling stories.

## The One That Changed Everything

If I had to pick one book from this list that changed how I think most fundamentally, it would be **How to Do Nothing** by Jenny Odell. In a world that demands constant productivity, it's a radical argument for the value of attention, of presence, of being rather than doing.

But really, each of these books changed something. They shifted my perspective, introduced me to new ideas, made me see familiar things in new ways. That's what good books do—they don't just inform, they transform.

Here's to another year of reading, of discovery, of being changed by the words of others.
