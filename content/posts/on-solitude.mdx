There is a difference between being alone and being lonely. This distinction, simple as it sounds, is one of the most important things I've learned about how to live.

Loneliness is a feeling of absence, of something missing. It's the ache of disconnection, the sense that you are cut off from others, that you don't belong. Solitude, by contrast, is a feeling of presence, of fullness. It's the experience of being with yourself, of finding that you are, in fact, good company.

We live in a culture that fears solitude. We fill our days with activity, our spaces with noise, our minds with distraction. We avoid being alone because we're afraid of what we might find there—boredom, emptiness, ourselves.

But solitude is not empty. It is full. It is the space where we can hear our own thoughts, where we can process our experiences, where we can come to know ourselves. It is the condition for creativity, for reflection, for the kind of deep work that requires sustained attention.

When I was younger, I was afraid of being alone. I filled every moment with something—music, podcasts, people, activity. I thought that being alone meant being lonely, that solitude was something to be avoided.

But over time, I've learned that solitude is not something to be endured. It is something to be cultivated. It is a skill, a practice, a way of being in the world that allows for depth and understanding.

The practice of solitude doesn't require isolation. You can be alone in a crowded room, and you can feel connected in complete silence. Solitude is an internal state, a quality of attention, a way of relating to yourself and to the world.

I've found that my best thinking happens in solitude. Not when I'm actively trying to think, but when I'm simply present, when I've created the space for ideas to emerge. The solution to a problem I've been wrestling with, the insight that clarifies something I've been confused about, the connection between ideas that seemed unrelated—these come not from effort, but from the space that solitude creates.

Solitude also allows for a different kind of relationship with others. When you can be comfortable alone, you can be with others without needing them to fill a void. You can listen more deeply, be more present, offer more of yourself because you're not trying to get something from the interaction.

This is not to say that connection isn't important. It is. We are social creatures, and relationships are essential to a well-lived life. But the quality of our connections depends, in part, on our capacity for solitude. When we can be alone without being lonely, we can be with others in a way that is more genuine, more generous, more present.

The photograph above was taken during a week I spent alone in a small cabin. No internet, no phone, no people. Just me, my thoughts, and the natural world around me. It was one of the most productive weeks of my life—not in terms of output, but in terms of understanding. I came back with clarity about things that had been unclear, with decisions made that had been pending, with a sense of myself that was more solid, more real.

This is what solitude offers: not escape from the world, but a deeper engagement with it. Not withdrawal, but presence. Not emptiness, but fullness.

We need both connection and solitude. The challenge is finding the right balance, creating the space for both in our lives. This requires intention, discipline, and the willingness to resist the pressure to always be doing, always be connected, always be available.

But the reward is worth it. In solitude, we find ourselves. And in finding ourselves, we become better able to be with others, to contribute, to create, to live fully.

The world will continue to demand our attention, to fill our time, to pull us outward. But we can choose, sometimes, to turn inward, to create the space for solitude, to be alone with ourselves.

It is in that space that we find what we've been looking for—not in the noise, but in the quiet, not in the crowd, but in the solitude, not in the doing, but in the being.
