We're a small team, and we plan to stay small. We believe that small teams can do better work, move faster, and create more meaningful products.

We're not hiring right now, but we're always interested in hearing from exceptional people who share our values:

- **Thoughtful work.** We care about quality, about getting things right, about the details that matter.

- **Autonomy.** We trust people to do their best work without micromanagement.

- **Balance.** We believe in sustainable work practices. Burnout helps no one.

- **Growth.** We want to work with people who are always learning, always improving, always curious.

If you think you might be a good fit, send us a note. We'll keep it on file for when we're ready to grow.

No recruiters, please.
