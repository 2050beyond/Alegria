title: About
---

We are a small team building thoughtful products for people who care about quality, simplicity, and meaning.

Our work is guided by a few principles:

**Restraint over excess.** We believe that less is more, that the best design is often the simplest, and that saying no is as important as saying yes.

**Quality over quantity.** We'd rather build one thing well than ten things poorly. Every detail matters, every decision counts.

**Long-term thinking.** We make decisions based on what will matter in ten years, not what will matter next quarter.

**Transparency.** We believe in being honest about our work, our process, and our mistakes. There's no value in pretending to be perfect.

We're based in [Location], but our team works remotely from around the world. We're always looking for people who share our values and want to build something meaningful.

If that sounds like you, we'd love to hear from you.
