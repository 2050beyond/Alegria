## How to Edit Your Website

Your website is now fully editable by you, without needing to understand code, Git, or Markdown.

### Getting Started (2 minutes)

1. **Go to your website**: Visit yoursite.com
2. **Click "Edit"**: Look for the "Edit this page" button in the top-right corner
3. **Log in with GitHub**: You'll be asked to log in with your GitHub account (one-time setup)
4. **Start editing**: Click any text on the page to edit it directly

### Editing Content

- **Click any text** to edit it right on the page
- **Use the toolbar** that appears for:
  - **Bold** and *Italic* text
  - Adding **Links**
  - Inserting **Images** (drag and drop anywhere)
  - Adding **YouTube/Vimeo videos**
- **Type naturally** — no Markdown syntax needed

### Creating New Blog Posts

1. Click **"+ New Post"** in the top menu (when editing)
2. Fill in the title and write your content
3. Add images or videos using the toolbar
4. Click **"Save & Publish"** when done

### Saving Your Changes

- Click the **"Save & Publish"** button (bottom-right when editing)
- Your changes are automatically committed to GitHub

### Images and Videos

- **Videos**: Click "Add Video" and paste your YouTube or Vimeo URL
- All media is automatically uploaded to your repository

### What You'll See

- **Edit mode**: When you're logged in and editing, you'll see editing controls
- **Normal mode**: Visitors see your site normally — no editing UI
- **Last updated**: When editing, you'll see who last updated the page and when

### Need Help?

If you get stuck:
1. Check the walkthrough modal (appears on first login)
2. Remember: you can't break anything — all changes are saved before publishing
3. If something looks wrong, just edit it again and save

### Important Notes

- **Always click "Save & Publish"** when you're done editing
- Changes go live automatically — no manual deployment needed
- Your original design and styling remain unchanged
- All content is stored safely in your GitHub repository

That's it! You now have full control over your website content.
